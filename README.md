# linux-traffic-shapers
wondershaper and a few others I've found around the net.  If you're not running a linux based router, you don't care.

I'm currently using wshaper in my home network but it's stopped limiting todal bandwidth and needs debugging.  wshaper.2 looks like the next best candidate but it's limiting downloads too much, so I'll be combingin the two and educating my self on linux 'tc'.
